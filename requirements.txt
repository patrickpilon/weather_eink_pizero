# Minimal dependencies for Raspberry Pi Zero
# Keep this list lean to reduce installation time and memory usage

# Image processing (required for e-ink display)
Pillow>=9.5.0,<11.0.0

# HTTP requests with connection pooling
requests>=2.31.0,<3.0.0

# YAML configuration parsing
PyYAML>=6.0,<7.0

# Timezone handling
pytz>=2023.3

# Caching utilities
cachetools>=5.3.0,<6.0.0

# E-ink display drivers
# Note: Waveshare drivers are included in lib/ directory

# Hardware-specific dependencies (only needed on Raspberry Pi hardware)
# Uncomment these lines if running on actual Raspberry Pi with e-ink display:
# spidev>=3.5
# gpiozero>=1.6.2
#
# Install with: pip install spidev gpiozero
# Note: These will fail to install on non-Pi systems, which is expected.
# The application will run in mock mode without these dependencies.

# System monitoring (optional, for performance tracking)
psutil>=5.9.0,<6.0.0

# Scheduled task execution (lightweight alternative to cron)
schedule>=1.2.0,<2.0.0
